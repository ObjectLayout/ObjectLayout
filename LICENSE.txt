Please view the LICENSE or LICENSE.txt files in the individual project 
directories for license details.

Some of the directories sub-projects under this repository (e.g.
the main ObjectLayout project with the org.ObjectLayout source)
are both placed in the public domain and licensed under a BSD
2-clause license. 

However, since some of the examples in the ObjectLayout-examples
project were ported from OpenJDK 8, those examples carry the
related GPLv2+CPE OpenJDK license. See details in the LICENSE
files in the specific subdirectories under the ObjectLayout-examples
source tree.
