        <h3>ObjectLayout: An optimised memory layout package.</h3>

        <p>
            The ObjectLayout package provides some core classes designed with optimised memory layout in mind.
        </p>
        <p>
            This package is motivated by the wish to create ways to express optimised memory layout and
            related execution semantics that are not currently directly expressible in Java, and to expose these
            semantics to Java applications without requiring any language changes. All ObjectLayout package classes
            are expected to provide and support their full functionality on all JVMs (of Java SE 5 or above) at
            reasonable layouts and execution speeds. However, the classes are designed with semantics that would
            allow an optimised JVM to implement them with improved memory and related execution optimizations.
        </p>
        <p>
            The StructuredArray class is a good example of this design pattern. StructuredArray is carefully
            designed to allow a JVM to store it in memory with a layout similar to an array of structs
            in C-like languages, and to internally use intrinsic representations for the related StructuredArray
            methods, exposing them to common optimizations. When a JVM optimises StructuredArray in such a way,
            array access benefits from both direct (as opposed to de-referenced) dead-reckoning index access, as
            well as from fixed memory strides during streaming operations.
        </p>
